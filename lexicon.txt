system-level test

stakeholder >< shareholder

equivalence class aka equivalence partition

combinatorial testing

test fixture: script or program used to put the system under test into a state that is ready for testing

stochastic testing (aka monkey testing): use random processes that can be analyzed using statistics; eg: Netflix's ChaosMonkey. smart monkey testing: random input is what a user might conceivably enter. dumb monkey testing: unlikely input (for edge cases)

fuzz testing: sending in randomly generated data to a system

mutation testing: during the test, modify the code in random ways, thus seeding the system with defects, and see if the test suite is going to catch the defects.
